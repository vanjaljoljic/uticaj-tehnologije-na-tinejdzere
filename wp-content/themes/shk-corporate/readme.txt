The theme uses the blue color variation that WordPress uses as default. You will find 3 separate header sidebars, which will be placed just above the menu section. The top header section is very useful when it comes to adding social media links, email IDs, contact information and any other important information that you want to share. All you need to do is add a few widgets and you are good to go.
In the SHK Corporate theme child theme, a new header variation and a different service section variation are there that are not in the parent theme.

The focus is moving back to the parent menu having submenus from the next menu in a reverse direction.
